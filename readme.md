# Introduction to robotics:

## Description: 

This Repo Contains the MATLAB code used to [simulate](SImulation.m)  the robotâ€™s [Kinematics](pumaForekinem.m),ensuring precise control of each joint and smooth, accurate movement and compute joint angles ([inverse kinematics](Inverse.m)) and end-effector positions ([forward kinematics](forwardkinematics.m)) for robotic arm of **PUMA** robot
